The complete lifecycle for managing your Conversational AI model includes:
* [Collecting Data](/guide/building-blocks/modeling/collecting-data): Gather utterances representative of what real users say
* [Measuring Accuracy](/guide/building-blocks/modeling/measuring-accuracy): Measure the system to see how well it is performing and where it is having problems
* [Training The Model](/guide/building-blocks/modeling/training-model): Make changes to the model to address errors identified via testing and monitoring
* [Monitoring Interactions](/guide/building-blocks/modeling/monitoring-interactions): Once the model is trained and put in production, it must be monitored on an ongoing basis to see how real users interact - figuring out what works and what does not.

Taken together, this is the lifecycle that defines building and optimizing a Conversational AI bot. This lifecycle is not a finite process, but instead is effective as long as the bot is live and interacting with real users.
